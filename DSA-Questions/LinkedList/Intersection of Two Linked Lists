// we find the interection point of two LL
// we travel both the pointer on both the LL -> first we move it till the end then we move it to the next head 
// idea is since we reach the end and move the next pointer the opposite end so we maintain the difference length and at a point it will be in the same distance
// since we don't want to stuck in infinte loop we keep the condition as while ( temp1 ! = temp2 ) since 
// if the LL don't colide at a point it reach both will reach null and it gets terimated
