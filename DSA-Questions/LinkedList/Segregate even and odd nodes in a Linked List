// We are making first half of the new linked list as even number and other half as odd number
// we would take 2 pointer node which is even and odd and also 2 dummy nodes
// atlast we would connect end of even to head of odd and end of odd to null

--> we can do the changes accordingly like even - odd or odd - even
